Camel is a QML based login manager.

Camel is written in C++ and uses some of the C++11 features. It has only
a few dependencies and is desktop environment agnostic.

To compile it you will need the Clang compiler (version 3.3 or above) and
the libc++ library, which are both part of the LLVM project (http://llvm.org).

You may also be able to compile it using later versions of the GCC and
the libstdc++ library. (I had trouble with gcc 4.7.3, as it does not fully
support C++11.)

Camel additionally requires the following packages:
    X.Org X server
    Qt (including QtDeclarative)
    PAM

For installation instructions, please refer to the INSTALL file.

Camel always runs in foreground and exits after successful login/logout cycle.
It is meant to be used in conjunction with a service manager (eg, OpenRC,
systemd, upstart, etc.) and the service manager should restart it upon exit.

Camel supports the following options:
    camel [-h|--help]
 or camel [:n] [<config-file>]

where:
    -h | --help     shows available options
    :n              overrides X server display name (default: :0)
    <config-file>   specifies config file to use (default: /etc/camel.conf)

Camel comes with a few basic themes. You can use any of them (or the minimal
theme) as a starting point to create your own. You are only limited by what
QML can do. Have fun!
